The Worst Day in DevOps
=======================

In a DevOps role you will have the **"occasional"** bad day. These days are marred by some intense anger by your customers as their service is degraded. These days are not fun and can be horribly stressful on you and your team. While you can not use automation to fix stupidity, you can have many of the recovery options of your topology available via automation. Automation can be used to reset the configuration of your network to the desired state.

Disaster Strikes
----------------

Oh no! Your firewalls are now no longer passing traffic. A team member accidentally made a mass change via a poorly written script. Several configuration elements have been changed across your topology and now your customers are furious they can't look at the new trailer for **Star Wars X: War of Automaters**. Calls are coming in from all over and managers are streaming into the room to watch your every move. How can you solve this problem?
